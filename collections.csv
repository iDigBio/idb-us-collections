The Midwest is strongly represented, as are Arizona and southeastern United States, thanks to multiple Academy expeditions during the mid-1900s. The collection contains many para- and holotypes, as well as one subspecies type specimen, of the Northern Crawfish Frog (Lithobates areolata circulosa).

The completion of a Revised Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Bandelier National Monument (Jacobs 2012) represents the first significant update to the flora of the monument in the 20 years since completion of the initial Flora of Bandelier project (Jacobs, 1989). Over 50 additional taxa are documented for the monument, bringing the total from around 746 species in 1989 to 800+ in 2012. The relatively high diversity of vascular plants (800+ taxa documented for 33,000 acre area) reflects the complex topography and wide range of climatic settings available across a nearly 5000-foot elevation range from the Rio Grande at 5300-feet to the summit of Cerro Grande at 10100-feet. However over 15% of the flora is non-native reflecting the legacy of historic landuse and modern disturbances. The monuments herbarium serves the dual purpose of documenting the monuments flora, while also providing a key botanical reference in support of research and monitoring efforts.",NA,NA,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",35.7651,-106.3221

The collection has significant systematic and taxonomic value in that it contains over 200 holotypes, including 183 bird and 48 mammal taxa.  In addition, the bird collection houses large numbers of specimens from many now-degraded habitats in Mexico and northern Central America, including a significant series by Thomas R. Howell of passerine birds inhabiting the lowland pine savannas of northeastern Nicaragua taken from the 1950s through the 1970s (Ornithological Monograph No. 68).  It also contains a small but important series of an endemic seabird, the Tristram’s Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma tristrami), and endemic land birds from the Hawaiian Islands, including the Laysan Finch (Telespiza cantans), and the Millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris) as well as an important series of the extinct Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) from the late 1870s and several California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) from the very early 1900s.",70000,TRUE,"","","","Kathy C.

"American Museum of Natural History","Invertebrate Zoology, Arachnida and Myriapoda","","","AMNH","","urn:uuid:2f3ebf02-a833-4bf3-b0a9-0b7fe56aa6b5","","http://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/collections/arachnida-non-spider-myriapoda","","The American Museum of Natural History houses the world's largest collection of spiders, with well over a million specimens and over 4,000 primary types. The collection is used extensively by most of the world's arachnologists. The geographic scope is worldwide, with special strengths in the New World. The AMNH also has the second-largest collection of scorpions, and the largest collection of minor arachnid orders in North America. The myriapod collections are also among the largest in North America. The collections include a worldwide representation of arachnid and myriapod taxa, with a strong emphasis on material from North America and elsewhere in the New World. The majority of specimens are preserved in ethanol, although large collections of slide-mounted Acari and pseudoscorpions are also represented. A small quantity of unsorted dried material, mostly from South America, is being rehydrated and transferred to ethanol. Collections are continually being augmented with new material collected by AMNH staff, or acquired as donations or purchases.

In 2002, the arachnid and myriapod collections were transferred to a new storage facility within the AMNH, the Starr Natural Sciences building (NSB). In the NSB, specimens are stored in state-of-the-art cabinetry and a climate-controlled environment to ensure their longevity. A complete overhaul of the collection, whereby all old, unstandardized bottles and vials, many with bake-lite closures or rubber stoppers, are replaced by new glass jars of standardized volumes with polyethylene closures and polypropylene-foam liners, has been underway for several years. The entire collection is also gradually being databased, and archival data labels newly printed for each specimen-lot.","Scorpions comprise the second largest component of the AMNH arachnid and myriapod collections, after spiders. Currently comprising over 30,000 specimen-lots, including several hundred type specimens, the AMNH has the fourth-largest scorpion collection in the world, including a vast array of New and Old World taxa. Several thousand specimens from South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, including numerous undescribed species, remain to be sorted and identified, and the collection continues to be increased as a result of active field projects. Particular strengths of the collections are in New World, and especially North American families. The AMNH has one of the two largest collections of vaejovid scorpions in the world (the California Academy of Sciences has the other). It incorporates the Oscar F. Francke collection, rich in vaejovid and iurid material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A., and containing many large series collected with U.V. light detection, but also containing material from elsewhere in the world. It also incorporates the Willis J. Gertsch collection, containing a significant amount of material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. Recent acquisition of the Alexis Harington collection (ca. 10,000 specimens) vastly expanded the holdings of African material. Southern African taxa are particularly well represented in this collection, which comprises a more representative sample than most southern African collections. All families and genera, and most species of southern African scorpions are represented; including many rare or seldom collected species. Most species are represented by series from multiple localities, many representing new records and/or range extensions. In addition, there are reasonable holdings of extralimital African taxa, and taxa from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. As part of Dr Prendini's research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of tissues from scorpions is steadily being deposited in the Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research of the AMNH. Developed through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with colleagues around the world, this collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples from Amblypygi, Schizomida, Solifugae and Thelyphonida and other arachnid and myriapod taxa, in addition to Scorpiones. Samples are housed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-150°C) to maintain the highest quality and maximum stability of biomolecules indefinitely.",NA,NA,"World's largest collection of spiders and second largest collection of scorpions.","Global, with strengths in the New World, North America and Africa.","More than a million spiders, and more than 30,000 lots of scorpions.","Lorenzo Prendini","Curator-in-charge","lorenzo@amnh.org","Central Park West at 79th St","New York","New York","10024-5192","Central Park West at 79th St","New York","New York","10024-5192","urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3","","","","","","",40.7866,-73.9684

Additional material includes Pennsylvanian, Permian, and Cretaceous compression-impression specimens from several localities in eastern and central Kansas and coal balls from the Midcontinent, USA. The Division of Paleobotany was instituted in 1995 when Edith L. Taylor and Thomas N. Taylor moved to the University of Kansas, bringing their extensive collection of fossil plants with them.

Roosevelt, the Patuxent Research Refuge is the nation's only national wildlife refuge established to support wildlife research. It is located located between Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD. At the time of the Refuge's establishment in 1936, botanist Neil Hotchkiss and other scientists surveyed the flora on the 2,650 acres which made up the Refuge. Lists of plants found on the Refuge were published in 1940 and 1947. The latter list tabulated 944 plant taxa. Voucher specimens were collected and reposited in the Refuge's herbarium. By 1980, when the refuge expanded to 4,741 acres, a total of 900 plant taxa were listed. In the early 1990's as part of the Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) process, the Department of Defense transferred about 8,100 acres of land from Fort Meade to the Department of Interior, with control of the land given to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The addition of this parcel, now known as the North Tract, brought the total acreage of the Refuge to over 12,800 acres. A floral survey of the North Tract began in 2010 and a re-survey of the older parcel of the Refuge, known as the Central and South Tracts, was initiated in 2013. As of December 2017, the herbarium holds almost 5,000 voucher specimens from over 1,250 taxa found on the Refuge. This includes a number of Maryland rare, threatened, and endangered (RTE) species, as well as at least five species new to Maryland. A number of duplicate and unique voucher specimens are held by other herbaria.","",NA,NA,"","Maryland, U.S.A","","Bill Harms","","botanybill@verizon.net","10901 Scarlet Tanager Loop","Laurel","Maryland","201708","10901 Scarlet Tanager Loop","Laurel","Maryland","201708","","","","","","","",39.0264,-76.8012

The Academy has had several prominent entomologists in its history, primarily between 1930 and 1960. Donald C. Lowrie (1910-2000) studied spiders and their role in local dune ecosystems. Leonora K. Gloyd (b. 1902) conducted fieldwork on Odonata. Orlando Park published on the taxonomy and ecology of Coleoptera, particularly the Pselaphidae, in the 1940s. Stanley Auerbach researched centipedes in the Chicago area during the 1950s. Other major collectors include Andrew Bolter (collected between 1879-1910) and Harry D. Sicher (collected between 1940 and 1970), both of whom collected primarily Lepidoptera. The majority of the non-Lepidopteran specimens were collected in the Midwest and Western Great Lakes regions, with Canada, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. also represented. Lepidoptera primarily include species from the Midwestern U.S. as well as Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Alaska, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. Temporal Coverage of this collection is 1834-Present, with the bulk of the non-Lepidoptera specimens collected between 1872 and 1911, and the bulk of Lepidopteran specimens collected between 1891 and 1964.","",NA,NA,"Majority of collection consists of Lepidoptera.

All pinned or pointed specimens are stored in 21 Cornell or U.S. National Museum (12 drawers each) insect cabinets. Three of these cabinets contains study specimens of all major orders and families of insects and are directly accessible by students for study and reference purposes. In addition, five vial cabinets (10 drawers each) are for storage of specimens preserved in alcohol.. The collection also has approximately 1200 microscope slides that have been purchased commercially, prepared by students or the result of research projects. Total numbers of pinned or pointed specimens for major groups of insects in the collection are: Coleoptera 7025; Lepidoptera 3293; Diptera 2754; Hymenoptera 2533; Hemiptera 2615; Orthoptera 771; and Odonata 394. Some adults of these and other Orders are preserved in alcohol.  There are approximately 10,000 vials with alcohol-preserved adult and immature specimens. Most of these vials have multiple specimens and no attempt has been made to count each specimen. Many of the alcohol-preserved specimens are aquatic immature insects. There are several thousand specimens of Chironomidae larvae resulting from a multiple-year study of chironomid populations in Lake Winnebago and the feeding habits of lake sturgeon. The collection also includes approximately 9,000 Australian specimens most of which are aquatic species, especially Trichoptera larvae (3,922 specimens), all of which are identified to family and many to species. Essentially all specimens have appropriate collection data labels. Many of the specimens were donated by students enrolled in the entomology classes. Most of these are local, regional or state specimens. However, specimens have been collected throughout the U.S. In 2011 the UWOIC became a part of a regional (22 midwestern collections) digitization effort (Invertnet) funded by NSF’s Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections. Currently about 5,000 specimens have been digitized for this on-going project.","",200000,NA,"","","200000","Gene Drecktrah","Curator Emeritus","drecktra@uwosh.edu","Department of Biology 800 Algoma Blvd.","Oshkosh","Wisconsin","54901","Halsey 142 921 Elmwood Ave.","Oshkosh","Wisconsin","54901","urn:uuid:8c02bca2-8bdc-4cd5-b25f-3938adc9cf17","","","","","","",44.0233,-88.5476

"American Museum of Natural History","Invertebrate Zoology, Arachnida: Araneae","","","AMNH","","urn:uuid:70aaed8a-0cb4-451e-a777-9e7b267485b7","","https://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/collections/arachnida-araneae","","The American Museum of Natural History houses the world's largest collection of spiders, with well over a million specimens and over 4,000 primary types. The collection is used extensively by most of the world's arachnologists. The geographic scope is worldwide, with special strengths in the New World. The AMNH also has the second-largest collection of scorpions, and the largest collection of minor arachnid orders in North America. The myriapod collections are also among the largest in North America. The collections include a worldwide representation of arachnid and myriapod taxa, with a strong emphasis on material from North America and elsewhere in the New World. The majority of specimens are preserved in ethanol, although large collections of slide-mounted Acari and pseudoscorpions are also represented. A small quantity of unsorted dried material, mostly from South America, is being rehydrated and transferred to ethanol. Collections are continually being augmented with new material collected by AMNH staff, or acquired as donations or purchases.

In 2002, the arachnid and myriapod collections were transferred to a new storage facility within the AMNH, the Starr Natural Sciences building (NSB). In the NSB, specimens are stored in state-of-the-art cabinetry and a climate-controlled environment to ensure their longevity. A complete overhaul of the collection, whereby all old, unstandardized bottles and vials, many with bake-lite closures or rubber stoppers, are replaced by new glass jars of standardized volumes with polyethylene closures and polypropylene-foam liners, has been underway for several years. The entire collection is also gradually being databased, and archival data labels newly printed for each specimen-lot.","Scorpions comprise the second largest component of the AMNH arachnid and myriapod collections, after spiders. Currently comprising over 30,000 specimen-lots, including several hundred type specimens, the AMNH has the fourth-largest scorpion collection in the world, including a vast array of New and Old World taxa. Several thousand specimens from South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, including numerous undescribed species, remain to be sorted and identified, and the collection continues to be increased as a result of active field projects. Particular strengths of the collections are in New World, and especially North American families. The AMNH has one of the two largest collections of vaejovid scorpions in the world (the California Academy of Sciences has the other). It incorporates the Oscar F. Francke collection, rich in vaejovid and iurid material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A., and containing many large series collected with U.V. light detection, but also containing material from elsewhere in the world. It also incorporates the Willis J. Gertsch collection, containing a significant amount of material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. Recent acquisition of the Alexis Harington collection (ca. 10,000 specimens) vastly expanded the holdings of African material. Southern African taxa are particularly well represented in this collection, which comprises a more representative sample than most southern African collections. All families and genera, and most species of southern African scorpions are represented; including many rare or seldom collected species. Most species are represented by series from multiple localities, many representing new records and/or range extensions. In addition, there are reasonable holdings of extralimital African taxa, and taxa from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. As part of Dr Prendini's research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of tissues from scorpions is steadily being deposited in the Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research of the AMNH. Developed through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with colleagues around the world, this collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples from Amblypygi, Schizomida, Solifugae and Thelyphonida and other arachnid and myriapod taxa, in addition to Scorpiones. Samples are housed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-150°C) to maintain the highest quality and maximum stability of biomolecules indefinitely.",NA,TRUE,"World's largest collection of spiders and second largest collection of scorpions.","Global, with strengths in the New World, North America and Africa.","More than a million spiders, and more than 30,000 lots of scorpions.","Lorenzo Prendini","Curator-in-charge","lorenzo@amnh.org","Central Park West at 79th St","New York","New York","10024-5192","Central Park West at 79th St","New York","New York","10024-5192","urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3","","","","","","",40.7866,-73.9684

Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the 'LEB'). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso's Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding.  Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012.  Collections primarily are of modern and fossil vertebrate biology (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and have a regional emphasis, but also contain material from outside the Southwest, particularly from Mexico.

The collection, worldwide in scope, has especially strong collections of U.S., Philippine and Central and South American birds. The holdings represent about 4,000 bird species. About 140 taxa are in the type collection. Extinct species are also represented. Formation of the collection began when the Museum was founded in 1957. Among the collections that can be found here are those of George Miksch Sutton, Allan R. Phillips, Olin S. Pettingill, T.D. Burleigh, D.S. Rabor, M. Hachisuka, and Sibley’s Yale-Peabody Expedition.

The holdings include at least 18 primary types and 150 paratypes, and dates of collection span from 1878 to the present. The dung beetle collection is the largest in the United States, and our scarab holdings are particularly strong in African as well as regional material. The Colorado Scarab Survey and the Colorado Microlepidoptera Survey, both long-term projects initiated and conducted by DMNS, are steadily growing our regional holdings and our knowledge of the Colorado fauna.

Approximately 225,000 specimens are permanently mounted on microscope slides; the remaining specimens are stored in alcohol in vials and jars. With the exception of one monospecific order - Acanthobdellida (the bristle worms, restricted in distribution to the boreal regions in the Arctic) - the collection includes representatives of the other groups of worms in the phylum Annelida: Branchiobdellida (one family, Branchiobdellidae - the crayfish worms, including representatives of the subfamilies Bdellodrilinae, Cambarincolinae, and Xironodrilinae); Hirudinida (the leeches, including representatives in five families – Haemopidae, Hirudinidae, Erpobdellidae, Glossiphoniidae, and Piscicolidae); the Oligochaetous Clitellata {'Oligochaeta'}, with representatives of the aquatic microdrile worms (families Enchytraeidae, Haplotaxidae, Lumbriculidae, Naididae {now including the subfamilies in the former family Tubificidae}, and Opistocystidae), and the terrestrial megadrile oligochaetes – earthworms (families Acanthodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Komarekionidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae, and Sparganophilidae); and Polychaeta (sand worms, tube worms, or clam worms – primarily marine) including a few representatives of the families Capitellidae and Sabellidae, and Aeolosomatida (one family, Aeolosomatidae – the head-crawling, or suction-feeding worms). Acquisition Highlights. An important acquisition for the INHS Annelida Collection in 1986 was the Walter J. Harman collection of terrestrial oligochaetes. The material in this collection, comprising 1,600 earthworm specimens representing 22 species, 10 genera, and 3 families, was collected by Dr. Harman from 230 sites in central Illinois during his 1956-1958 survey for his doctoral work at the University of Illinois. The information in Harman's thesis, previously unpublished records in Harman's original field notes, and records of other terrestrial oligochaetes collected over the years in Illinois and deposited in the INHS Annelida Collection were recently presented in a publication by Reynolds and Wetzel (2011): Megadrilogica 18 (4): 35-67. The INHS Annelida Collection contains primary types of six leech and one aquatic oligochaete species. The geographic scope of the INHS Annelida Collection is as follows: 76% from Illinois, 23% from elsewhere in North America (collections from the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida (including the Conch Republic), Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. John Island), and from the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nunavut, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island), and 1% from other countries, including Australia, the Bahamas, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Greenland, India, Jamaica, Lesser Antilles (Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, Granada, Nexis, St. Lucia), The Netherlands, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Sweden, and Venezuela.","",350000,NA,"The INHS Annelida Collection is perhaps the largest state collection of freshwater oligochaetes in the country, holding 350,000 specimens (over 7,000 lots, or collections).

Between the years 1895 and 1897, M.C. Jensen, a student and botanist, collected more than 70 specimens within the city of Lake Forest, IL, and added these to the College’s collection.

Dr. Elizabeth Teter Lunn, a Professor of Biology at the College from 1929 to 1970 assiduously presided over and put together a large portion of our current collection. Dr. Kenneth Weik, Professor of Biology Emeritus, worked with Elizabeth T. Lunn within the biological boundaries of the college.

The paleobiology collection (UNMP) includes over 25,000 specimens, primarily of marine invertebrate and terrestrial plant fossils. The collection spans the entire Phanerozoic Eon and the geographic scope is global, with an emphasis on specimens from New Mexico and the surrounding region. Many of these regional specimens are not well represented in other academic or national museum collections. Flora and fauna from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous Periods are particularly well represented. The collection also includes more than 50 type specimens of Pennsylvanian and Early Cretaceous mollusks, and Pennsylvanian insects. Preservation of specimens is primarily as body or trace fossils.","",NA,NA,"","","","Corinne Myers","Curator of Invertebrate Paleontology","cemyers@unm.edu","1 Northrop Hall, Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico","Albuquerque","New Mexico","87131","221 Yale Blvd. NE","Albuquerque","New Mexico","87131","","","","","","","",35.0833,-106.6282

Today’s herbarium holds approximately 4500 specimens and, though it includes bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and fungi, flowering plants comprise nearly 90% of the total.","",NA,NA,"","","","Nick Stoynoff","","mr_sto@att.net","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",41.540526,-90.580645

This diversity is most notable among the freshwater and terrestrial Mollusca. Approximately 200 of the 300 known species of North American freshwater mussels have been reported from the waters of Alabama, and these systems once supported nearly 250 species of aquatic snails. Additionally, there are 85 species of crayfish in Alabama, the highest of any state in the US. Unfortunately, this spectacular biodiversity has been severely compromised by human activities. Modification of large river systems has resulted in substantial habitat loss, and many aquatic species now have highly fragmented distributions.In 1999 we began to accumulate material from Alabama’s populations of mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates.","",NA,NA,"","",">20,000 cataloged lots","Jack W.

This collection was originally established by Stanley A. Wilkes in the early 1970s and has been maintained by Stephen M. Shuster since 1990. Specimens from the northern Gulf of California and the western coast of North America form the core of the collection. However, specimens from eastern North America, the Caribbean Sea, the tropical Pacific islands, and the southwestern United States are also well represented in the collection. In 2010, more than 600 marine and freshwater mollusc shells, which made up the Lois Richards Shell Collection, were added to the museum.

There are approximately 100,000 specimens housed in 112 cases. The major collections include plants of Trans-Pecos Texas, which forms the largest part of the northern part of the Chihuahuan Desert Region in the United States. It is a prominent regional research collection that is available to botanists around the world and is also a valuable teaching facility for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in various botanical disciplines or in wildlife biology. The first significant collections are those made by O.E. Sperry in 1935-1946. The physical herbarium was probably started by L.C. Hinkley but B.H. Warnock was responsible for the largest early collection of plants and major development of the herbarium as a research facility. Another major contributor was M.C Johnston. More recently, the herbarium has grown through the efforts of A.M. Powell, in whose honor the university renamed the herbarium in 2003.","",NA,NA,"","plants of Trans-Pecos Texas, which forms the largest part of the northern part of the Chihuahuan Desert Region in the United States","100,000","A.

An important addition in 1965 was the donation of 3,600 specimens from S. S. Gregory, which includes the extinct Ivory-billed Woodpeckers and Carolina Parakeets. In all, 583 species of North American birds are represented. Thirty percent of the birds were collected before 1900, including important Illinois specimens from Robert Kennicott and Benjamin T. Gault. There is also a valuable collection of nearly 1,000 Alaskan skins. Other notable collectors include Alfred M. Bailey, P. Brodkorb, Charles D. Brower, Henry K. Coale, Francis S.

In all, MNA houses more than 300,000 invertebrate specimens. A total of 79,253 specimens have been databased, including 4,899 species in 1,655 genera among 409 families in 67 orders or higher taxa. The collection features extensive or complete collections of the spiders, butterflies, dragonflies, grasshoppers, and aculeate Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) of the southern Colorado Plateau. In many cases the MNA holdings are the only complete collections of those taxa from the region. For example, the MNA collection contains 30 tiger beetle taxa from the southern Colorado Plateau, of which nearly one quarter are endemic (unique) to the region.  Also, of the nearly 150 butterfly taxa represented from the southern Plateau in the MNA collections, at least 7 (5%) are endemic. More than 20 (10.5%) of the 191 robber fly species in the MNA database may be new to science.","",NA,NA,"","Colorado Plateau","","Janet Whitmore Gillette","Collection Manager","jgillette@musnaz.org","3101 North Fort Valley Road","Flagstaff","Arizona","86001","Fort Valley Road, U.S. Highway 180.","Flagstaff","Arizona","86001","","","","","","","",35.1972,-111.6481
