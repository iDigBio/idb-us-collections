    "description": "The Grinnell College Herbarium includes a collection of approximately 27,000 specimens, mainly of vascular plants. An 1883 gift of over 3,000 specimens from Ward's Scientific forms the nucleus of the present collection. (A tornado in 1882 destroyed the original Grinnell College Herbarium.) That founding gift contained plants from around the world; international collections have continued through gifts, exchanges, and student and faculty research. The main focus of the collection is the flora of Iowa. Henry S. Conard (Professor of Botany, 1906-1944) used the herbarium as source material for several editions of The Grinnell Flora, which became in later editions, first Plants of Central Iowa, and, eventually, Plants of Iowa.",
