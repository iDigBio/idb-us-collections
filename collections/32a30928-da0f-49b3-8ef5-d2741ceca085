	"description": "This collection contains quartz microfiber particulate mass filters (NEON sample class: dpm_fieldData_in.sampleID). Particulate mass sampling is executed at 6 of NEONâ€™s terrestrial sites, located in Domains 10, 13, and 15. The subset of sites included for sampling are those in the Basin and Range, Eastern and Western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, and the Eastern plains of Colorado. This selection of sites enables focus on transportation of particulate matter from the Great Basin and the Colorado Plateau by prevailing westerly winds over the Colorado Rocky Mountains, to receptor sites in the Rockies and Great Plains. Samples are collected by an automated assembly that pulls air through a quartz microfiber filter with a porosity of 10 micrometers, to collect PM10. Filters are weighed at high precision pre- and post-deployment to determine dust deposition mass. In addition to determining mass concentration of PM10, filters from the particulate mass analyzers are archived at 4 degrees Celsius in air-tight plastic sleeves. Subsamples of the filters are available to the science community upon request to enable the assessment of chemical and nutrient inputs in the region. See related links below for protocols and NEON related data products.",
