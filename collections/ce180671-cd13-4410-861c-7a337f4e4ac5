	"description": "This collection contains subsamples of Carabid adults from pitfall sampling (NEON sample class: bet_archivepooling_in.subsampleID.bet). Ground beetles are sampled using pitfall traps (16 oz deli containers filled with 150 or 250 mL of propylene glycol). Four traps are deployed in each of 10 plots at each terrestrial NEON site (40 traps per site), with traps arrayed approximately 20 meters from the center of the plot in each of the four cardinal directions. Sampling occurs biweekly throughout the growing season (when temperatures are above 4 degrees C). Following trap collection, all beetles from the family Carabidae are sorted by NEON technicians and identified to species or morphospecies. A subset of collected Carabidae are pointed or pinned, while other specimens (non-pinned/non-pointed carabids, invertebrate bycatch, and vertebrate bycatch) are stored in 95% ethanol for archiving, and may be pooled into a single archive vial per plot. Regardless of storage method, all collections data are reported at a per trap resolution. A subset of pinned ground beetles (up to 467 per site per year) are sent to an expert taxonomist for secondary identification. Identifications performed on these individuals may be used to estimate uncertainty in parataxonomist identification by NEON technicians. These samples are single species Carabid lots pooled across traps. See related links below for protocols and NEON related data products.",
