    "description": "Worldwide in scope though with a focus on the American West, the Entomology collection at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science comprises over 1,000,000 specimens and specimen lots. It contains over 950,000 specimens, with Coleoptera (750,000+ specimens) and Lepidoptera (130,000+ specimens) as primary foci. The holdings include at least 18 primary types and 150 paratypes, and dates of collection span from 1878 to the present. The dung beetle collection is the largest in the United States, and our scarab holdings are particularly strong in African as well as regional material. The Colorado Scarab Survey and the Colorado Microlepidoptera Survey, both long-term projects initiated and conducted by DMNS, are steadily growing our regional holdings and our knowledge of the Colorado fauna. The collection is housed in the Avenir Collections Center - an onsite state-of-the-art museum collections facility.",
