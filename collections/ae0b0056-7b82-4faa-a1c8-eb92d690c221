	"description": "This collection contains pinned mosquito vouchers from CO2 trapping (NEON sample class: mos_identification_in.individualIDList). When adult mosquitoes are active, sampling occurs (via CDC light traps) every two weeks at core sites and every four weeks at relocatable sites. A sampling bout consists of two trapping nights and the intervening day for up to ten plots per site. Following collection, samples are sent to a professional taxonomist where a subsample of each catch generated from each trap is identified to species and sex. See related links below for protocols and NEON related data products.",
