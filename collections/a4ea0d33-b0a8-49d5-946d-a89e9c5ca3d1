	"description": "This collection contains small mammals collected as bycatch during ground beetle sampling (NEON sample class: bet_sorting_in.subsampleID.mam). Ground beetle abundance and diversity are sampled via pitfall trapping at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites. Vertebrate bycatch is stored in 95% ethanol and archived in a temperature (17-18Â°C) and humidity controlled environment. These are single species lots collected from the same pitfall trap. See TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle Sampling and TOS Science Design for Ground Beetle Abundance and Diversity (https://data.neonscience.org/documents) for more information about this sample class.",
