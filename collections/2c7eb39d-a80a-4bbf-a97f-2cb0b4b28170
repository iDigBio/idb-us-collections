	"description": "This collection contains bulk soil samples for microbial sequencing analyses (NEON sample classes: sls_soilCoreCollection_in.geneticArchiveSample1ID, sls_soilCoreCollection_in.geneticArchiveSample2ID, sls_soilCoreCollection_in.geneticArchiveSample3ID, sls_soilCoreCollection_in.geneticArchiveSample4ID, sls_soilCoreCollection_in.geneticArchiveSample5ID). At most sites, sampling bouts occur three times during the year in order to capture the prevailing conditions at the site during different seasons. Samples are collected on dry ice in the field and archived at -80 degrees Celsius. See related links below for protocol. Visit https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/explore for NEON related data products.",
