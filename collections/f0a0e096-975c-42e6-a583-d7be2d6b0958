	"description": "This collection contains fish vouchers collected from wadeable streams and lakes (NEON sample class: fsh_perFish_in.voucherSampleID, fsh_nonTarget_in.voucherSampleID). Fish are sampled twice per year at lakes and wadeable stream sites, during spring and fall. Ten sampling reaches or segments are established at each site; with 3 fixed reaches sampled during every sampling bout and a random subset of 3 additional reaches or segments selected for sampling each year. Fish are sampled using a combination of electrofishing, gill-nets and mini-fyke nets. Field technicians identify fish to the lowest practical taxonomic level and then weigh and measure a subset of captured individuals before releasing. Only mortalities and individuals that require euthanasia due to injuries are vouchered. Vouchers that are in good condition are fixed in 10% buffered formalin preservative and then transferred to 70% ethanol or isopropanol for long-term storage. Vouchers that are in poor condition are not fixed but preserved in 95% ethanol. Specimens are archived in a temperature (17-18Â°C) and humidity controlled environment. See related links below for protocols and NEON related data products.",
