	"description": "This collection contains surface water microbe samples collected on 0.22 um Sterivex capsule filters (NEON sample class: amc_fieldCellCounts_in.archiveID). SSurface water microbe samples are collected at the same time and location as surface water cell count samples and surface water chemistry samples once per month in wadeable streams (12 times per year) and every-other month in lakes and rivers (6 times per year). Details on sampling locations and timing are provided in the NEON document titled Surface Water Chemistry Sampling in Aquatic Habitats (https://data.neonscience.org/documents). In wadeable streams, surface water microbe samples are collected near the downstream S2 sensor location. In lakes, microbial samples are collected near the the buoy, inlet, and outlet sensors, and sampling depth(s) is dependent on lake stratification. In rivers, microbial samples are collected near the buoy sensor. Water samples are filtered on 0.22 um Sterivex capsule filters, capped and flash-frozen in the field. Sterivex filters are archived at the NEON Biorepository at -80 degrees Celsius. See related links below for protocol.",
