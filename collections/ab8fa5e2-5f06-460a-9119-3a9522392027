    "description": "The CCBER vascular plant collection emphasizes specimens from California, especially from the Santa Barbara area. It includes materials from highly sensitive coastal wetland habitats in central and southern California, including both coasts of Baja California. In addition, there is a valuable collection of vernal pool material as well as material from the California transverse mountain ranges and the Carrizo Plain, both climatically and biogeographically unique regions with high endemism. The collection also includes specimens from elsewhere in the United States, southern Africa, New Zealand, and Australia.",
