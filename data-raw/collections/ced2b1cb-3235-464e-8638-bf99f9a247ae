    "taxonomic_coverage": "The collection consists of skins, skeletal materials, fluid-preserved bodies, nests, eggs, taxidermy mounts, and frozen avian tissue samples. The strength of the collection is in its time-series of Texas holdings. Important holdings include materials from the Texas Memorial Museum (TMM, an orphaned collection of ~1650 skins, skeletal materials, taxidermy mounts, nests, and eggs, acquired from the University of Texas in March 2001), several hybrids, and extensive series of several species and species complexes from the U.S., Mexico, and Ecuador. Oldest specimen is from 1866; most recent is from 2014. Most extant avian orders are represented in the collection. There are 80 rare species/species of national or international conservation concern present in the collection. There is one type specimen (a symbiotype, host for a holotype parasite species).",
    "geographic_range": "Most of the specimens are from Texas, but there are also materials from most other U.S. states and 19 other countries from all seven continents.",
